      <h5> This HTML viewer is pretty decent </br> It can tell you how many characters are in a line </br> and shows line numbers</br> best part, you can just search a webpage! You don't have to download </br> the html for a page to see it's raw HTML anymore!</h5>
<!--There can be hidden stuuf you'd never see without an HTML viewer or that pesky console>
It's just hidden to all who don't look.
-->      
<h5>You might even find stuff</br> you didn't expect to see!</br> Like comments in HTML explaining what something does</br> or even things that were just commented out such as</br> scrapped ideas or unfinished features.</h5>    
<h5>This is not really a multi-tool,</br> it's like a browser but it can display</br> the HTML only, it changes title based off</br> the title tag... if it isn't multi-lined or embedded in some other tag.</h5>
